#### Binary Search Tree

A __binary search tree (BST)__, sometimes also called an __ordered__ or __sorted binary tee__, is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has a comparable key (and an associated value) and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node's left sub-tree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right sub-tree.
