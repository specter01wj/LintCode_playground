# Reverse Bits

> Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

## Example

Given input `43261596` (represented in binary as `00000010100101000001111010011100`), return `964176192` (represented in binary as `00111001011110000010100101000000`).

## Follow up:

If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
