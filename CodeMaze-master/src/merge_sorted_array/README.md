# Merge Sorted Array

> Given two sorted integer arrays _nums1_ and _nums2_, merge _nums2_ into _nums1_ as one sorted array.

## Notice

You may assume that _nums1_ has enough space (size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_) to hold additional elements from _nums2_. The number of elements initialized in _nums1_ and _nums2_ are _m_ and _n_ respectively.

## Solution

- Use two pointers start from `hi`. [Java](solution1.java)
