# Reverse Words in a String

> Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

## Example

Given s = "`the sky is blue`",

return "`blue is sky the`".

## Notice

- What constitutes a word?
    - A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
- Could the input string contain leading or trailing spaces?
    - Yes. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- How about multiple spaces between two words?
    - Reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

## Solution

- Use Stack to reverse words. [Java](solution1.java)
