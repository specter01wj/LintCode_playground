# Implement Stack using Queues

> Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.
> - push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
> - pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
> - top() -- Get the top element.
> - empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.

## Notice

- You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a queue.
-You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).

## Solution

- Use two queses, [Java](solution1.java)
- Use one queue, [Java](solution2.java)
