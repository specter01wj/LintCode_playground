# Maximum Subarray

> Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

## Example

given the array `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`,

the contiguous subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum = `6`.

## Follow up

If you have figured out the _O(n)_ solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Solution

- Brute Force. Time limit exceeded. [Java](solution1_0.java)
- Dynamic Programming. [Java](solution1.java)
- Divide and conquer. [Java](solution2.java)
