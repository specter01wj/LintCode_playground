# Subsets II

> Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, _nums_, return all possible subsets.
>
> __Notice__
>
> Each element in a subset must be in non-descending order.
>
> The ordering between two subsets is free.
>
> The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

## Example

If _nums_ = `[1,2,2]`, a solution is:

```
[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Challenge

Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?
