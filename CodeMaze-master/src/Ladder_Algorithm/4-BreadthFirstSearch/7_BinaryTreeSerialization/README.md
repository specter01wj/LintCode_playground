# Clone Graph

> Design an algorithm and write code to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Writing the tree to a file is called 'serialization' and reading back from the file to reconstruct the exact same binary tree is 'deserialization'.

> __Notice__: There is no limit of how you `deserialize` or `serialize` a binary tree, LintCode will take your output of serialize as the input of deserialize, it won't check the result of serialize.

## Example

An example of testdata: Binary tree `{3,9,20,#,#,15,7}`, denote the following structure:

```
  3
 / \
9  20
  /  \
 15   7
```
