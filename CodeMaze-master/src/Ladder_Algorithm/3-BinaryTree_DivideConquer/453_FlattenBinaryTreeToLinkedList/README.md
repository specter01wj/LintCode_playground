# Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

> Flatten a binary tree to a fake "linked list" in pre-order traversal.
>
> Here we use the right pointer in TreeNode as the next pointer in ListNode.

## Example

```
                1
                 \
    1             2
   / \             \
  2   5    =>       3
 / \   \             \
3   4   6             4
                       \
                        5
                         \
                          6

```

## Challenge
