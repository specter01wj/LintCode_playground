# Binary Tree Paths

> Given a binary tree, find all paths that sum of the nodes in the path equals to a given number `target`.

> A valid path is from root node to any of the leaf nodes.

## Example

Given a binary tree, and target = `5`:

```
    1
   / \
  2   4
 / \
2   3
```

return:

```
[
	[1, 2, 2],
	[1, 4]
]
```
