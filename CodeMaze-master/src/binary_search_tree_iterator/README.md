# Binary Search Tree Iterator

> Design an iterator over a binary search tree with the following rules:

> - Elements are visited in ascending order (i.e. an in-order traversal)

> - `next()` and `hasNext()` queries run in `O(1)` time in __average__.

> __Example__

> For the following binary search tree, in-order traversal by using iterator is `[1, 6, 10, 11, 12]`,

```
   10
 /    \
1      11
 \       \
  6       12
```

## Solution

Actually this is an inorder traversal
